                <p>I, Christian Beckford, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SPRING 2025, ITIS 3135, Web-Based Application Design and Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.</p>
                <p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given the structure and content of this class, it's possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates' code directly.</p>
                <p>I swear that I will only use these resources to learn and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e., external libraries) and never from my classmates.</p>
                <p>Signed: Christian Beckford, 27/01/2025</p>
